####Installation
To run the **House-Harmonic-Filler** you need the latests stable Pd-vanilla distribution (0.46.7). You can download it from Miller Puckette's website (http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html), of from the Pd main site (http://puredata.info). Beware that Pd-extended is now obsolete. For ease of use, we have included with this download all the externals needed, so downloading this repository is all you need to do to start using the program, once you have Pd installed.

*(Tested on on Ubuntu 15.10 and OSX Sierra)*
